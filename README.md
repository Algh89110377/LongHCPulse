# LongHCPulse
Code for processing long pulse heat capacity data taken on a Quantum Design PPMS
Please cite ___________

The main file here is "PPMS_LongPulse.py". This contains the class LongHCPulse, which computes and plots heat capacity.
This is the file you should import into your python scripts.

YbTiO_HeatCapacity.ipynb is an ipython notebook that gives an example of LongHCPulse being used to process heat capacity data
in https://arxiv.org/pdf/1703.06904.pdf.
"DRPuck27.cal", "Yb2Ti2O7_longpulse.raw", and "YbTiO_MvsB_100mK.txt" are all data files used in YbtiO_HeatCapacity.ipynb.
